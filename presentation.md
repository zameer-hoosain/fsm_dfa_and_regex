# Introduction

---

# Finite State Machines

- State represents the entirety of what is needed for the system to work
- Finite number of states
- One start state
- States are connected using transitions
- May have one or more "accepting" states
  - Not a requirement for machines designed to run indefinitely

## Vending Machine Example:

# Why is this useful?

- String processing and matching
  - Compilers
- UIs
- E-commerce
- AI
- Video Games
- Control systems
